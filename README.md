>if u see me online during the day *__99% of the time i'm afk w/ my friend @fuzzy-cactus__* while were in class -
if u come up to me & I don't reply, I promise I'm not ignoring u! Just off-tab doing work 

> I cuddle/kiss ponies a lot - it doesn't mean I ship the characters nor is it meant to be romantic! 

> I don't hide a lot of people but I hide anyone under the proship tree near the mw area immediately - sorry if u were just sitting under there & didnt know about the area and I hid u I just don't wanna risk it


> Shipping: **Squid game** ✅ I'm okay w/ doing any ships from squid game as along as they aren't illegal etc . . . **Mouthwashing** ❌ pls don't do any ships with me if I'm cosplaying as a mw character - I just don't feel comfortable with it sorry 😭 joke ships r okay tho ofc!! (and canon x oc idm :33 )
</p> thanks 4 reading!!
