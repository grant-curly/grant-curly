>if u see me online during the day *__99% of the time i'm afk w/ my friend @fuzzy-cactus__* while were in class -
if u come up to me & I don't reply, I promise I'm not ignoring u! Just off-tab doing work 

> I cuddle/kiss ponies a lot - it doesn't mean I ship the characters nor is it meant to be romantic! 

> I don't hide a lot of people but I hide anyone under the proship tree near the mw area immediately - sorry if u were just sitting under there & didnt know about the area and I hide u unfairly, I just dont wanna risk it lol 

</p> thanks 4 reading!!
